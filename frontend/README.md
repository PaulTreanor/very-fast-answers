# Frontend
Pretty simple frontend with React (vite) and TailwindCSS. 

The frontend calls the backend so it must be running first. So far it's only set up to call the backend if it's running locally. 

## Run it 
```bash
# if you see bun, you can also use npm 
bun i 
bun run dev
```

Use the dropdown above the input box to run local backend or AWS deployed backend. 

**Host this with Vercel for hackathons**. This is by far the quickest and easiest way to deploy a site, especially if you want to use a custom domain.
